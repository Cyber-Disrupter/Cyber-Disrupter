### 🛠️ Current Focus: The XFCE "Hacker Dashboard"
I'm currently customizing an XFCE-based Linux environment to keep my pentesting and monitoring tools one click away.
- **Features:** Custom Genmon/Netload monitors, automated Burp Suite launchers.
- **Goal:** Maximum efficiency for security auditing and system health tracking.

### 📜 Certifications
- **Google Cybersecurity Professional**
- **Google IT Support Professional**

### 🤖 Automation & AI
I use AI to automate documentation and script boilerplate, allowing me to focus on high-level architecture and security analysis. *This README is part of an iterative process of refining my professional presence.*

### 🧰 The Toolkit
- **OS:** Linux (XFCE Customization)
- **Security:** Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite
- **Scripting:** Python, Bash (Automating system health checks)
  
### 📡 Networking Lab
- **Tailscale Implementation:** Configured a secure peer-to-peer VPN mesh to link my XFCE Dashboard with remote nodes.
- **Goal:** Maintaining a secure, encrypted "Command Center" that follows Zero Trust principles.
-  See Network & Admin (LAB)


The following project documents a security assessment of a remote lab environment. It demonstrates a full "Observe, Analyze, and Test" workflow using industry-standard tools within a custom-configured XFCE Linux environment networked to above lab system.

### 🛡️ Remote Cyber Lab: Network & Web Security Audit

🛠️ Toolset & Methodology
- Net Sweep (Host Discovery): Utilized Nmap and fping to map the remote subnet, identifying active hosts and exposed services (Port 80/443).
- Wireshark (Traffic Analysis): Conducted deep packet inspection (DPI) to monitor data in transit. Focused on identifying unencrypted protocols (HTTP) and analyzing TCP handshakes to detect potential network anomalies.
- Burp Suite (Application Security): Acts as a local proxy to intercept and manipulate web traffic. Leveraged Repeater and Intruder to test for OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, specifically focusing on input validation and session management.

- All tools are integrated into a custom XFCE "Hacker Dashboard" featuring one-click launchers and Genmon system monitors for real-time resource tracking during active scans.
